# Revit BIM

Revit R25 model (Architectural, Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing).

All 3 MEP files are linked from the Architectural model.

All assets in the 3 MEP models have unique values for the instance parameter "Mark". These symbols are used on Schedules and in the Semantic Model as identifiers.
